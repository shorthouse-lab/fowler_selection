# Files relating to mutational selection in Fowler et al.

This repository containing jupyter notebooks and calculations for studying mutational selections in fowler et al. 


This repository makes heavy use of the library "Darwinian Shift" from Hall et al published here: https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05136-y and available here: https://github.com/michaelhall28/darwinian_shift

There is a folder for each gene containing a jupyter notebook file with all the calculations and figures.

Foldx and Foldx_binding folders contain the DDG values calculated for mutational stability DDG, or mutational binding DDG using foldx: https://foldxsuite.crg.eu
